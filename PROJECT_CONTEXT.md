# Project Context: BrowserLoop MCP Screenshot Server

## Current State: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

BrowserLoop is a **complete and production-ready MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that provides screenshot capabilities to AI development tools like Cursor. The project has successfully implemented comprehensive **cookie-based authentication** support with modern security standards.

**✅ Repository is now clean and ready for open source distribution** - all non-generic identifiers have been replaced with generic examples suitable for public use.

## 🎯 **Latest Major Achievement: Cookie Authentication System**

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE AND WORKING**

The cookie authentication system has been fully implemented and tested:

### ✅ **Technical Implementation Complete**
- **RFC 6265 compliant domain validation** - supports parent domain cookies (`.example.com` → `app.example.com`)
- **Modern cookie prefix support** - `__Host-` and `__Secure-` prefixed cookies work correctly
- **Automatic cookie enhancement** - built-in enhancement respects existing attributes and only adds missing ones
- **Comprehensive security validation** - prevents injection attacks and sanitizes logging
- **Environment variable support** - `BROWSERLOOP_DEFAULT_COOKIES` for persistent authentication
- **Cookie merging system** - combines default and request cookies intelligently
- **🎉 Browser extension format support** - direct import from Cookie Editor, EditThisCookie, etc. (no manual enhancement needed)

### ✅ **Browser Extension Cookie Support**
**NEW FEATURE**: Users can now directly use cookie files exported from browser extensions without editing!

- ✅ **Session cookies** (`expires: -1`) supported
- ✅ **Float timestamps** (like `1750704030.825311`) handled properly
- ✅ **All security attributes** (`httpOnly`, `secure`, `sameSite`) respected
- ✅ **Cookie prefixes** (`__Host-`, `__Secure-`) work with security enforcement
- ✅ **No manual editing required** - use browser extension exports directly

### 📋 **Authentication Usage**
```bash
# Set default cookies for automatic authentication
export BROWSERLOOP_DEFAULT_COOKIES="/path/to/cookies.json"

# Cookies are automatically injected for all requests
# Supports modern authentication patterns (Next.js, analytics, etc.)
```

**Note**: Authentication failures are typically due to **expired server sessions** (normal security behavior), not technical issues. Users should refresh their authentication cookies when sessions expire.
