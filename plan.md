- [x] **MCP Protocol Compatibility Fix**
  - [x] **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Console logging was breaking MCP stdio communication

  - [x] **SOLUTION**: Removed all console.log/console.error from production code paths
  - [x] **VERIFICATION**: File watching now works silently in MCP environment
  - [x] **TESTING**: Maintained full debugging capabilities in test mode with mock watchers

- [x] **ScreenshotService Dynamic Configuration Fix**
  - [x] **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: ScreenshotService was using stale configuration snapshot from startup
  - [x] **ROOT CAUSE**: ScreenshotService held a static reference to serviceConfig.authentication.defaultCookies from initialization time
  - [x] **SOLUTION**: Modified ScreenshotService.createScreenshotConfig() to fetch fresh authentication config from ConfigManager
  - [x] **VERIFICATION**: ScreenshotService now uses config.getAuthenticationConfig() for each screenshot operation
  - [x] **TESTING**: Verified that configuration changes are immediately reflected in new screenshot requests

- [x] **File Watcher Recreation After Rename Events Fix**
  - [x] **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: File watcher stopped working after first change due to editor file replacement behavior
  - [x] **ROOT CAUSE**: Editors create temp files and rename them to replace originals, leaving fs.watch() watching dead inodes
  - [x] **SOLUTION**: Added watcher recreation logic for 'rename' events with proper cleanup and delayed recreation
  - [x] **IMPLEMENTATION**: Created recreateWatcher() method with file existence checks and 100ms delay for file operations
  - [x] **VERIFICATION**: File watcher now survives multiple file edits and continues monitoring indefinitely

  - [x] Add troubleshooting guide for file watching issues
  - [x] Manual configuration refresh available via `config.refreshConfig()` method for edge cases
  - [x] **Updated documentation for file-based logging**: README.md and Cookie Authentication Guide now reflect new `/tmp/browserloop.log` logging
  - [x] **Removed BROWSERLOOP_SILENT environment variable**: No longer needed since file logging doesn't interfere with MCP protocol
  - [x] **COMPLETE**: Automatic file watching resolves MCP caching issues and works correctly in production MCP environments
